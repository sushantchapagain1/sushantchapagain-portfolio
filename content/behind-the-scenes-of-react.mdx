Let's start with the basics by understanding what a component is and how it works.
A component is like a blueprint or template of a UI that returns a React element in the element tree, it is usually written in JSX.
From this blueprint or template, we can create one or multiple `component instances` when we use the component.
Each component instance has its own state, props, and lifecycle methods mount, update/rerender, and unmount (more about this later).

When using a component technically its a component instance each component instance will return a `react element`.Component is usually
written in JSX however JSX in transplied to vanilla js with the `React.createElement` function calls by the transpilers like [babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/#jsx-and-react) or other transpilers.
So using component will return a react element that element is a imutable javscript object with necessary properties that react keeps in memory
to create DOM elements for the current component instance.

The `$$typeof` property in react element is used by react to prevent from cross site scripting attacks. notice
that the value of the property is `Symbol` which is a primitive data type in js which cannot be transmitted via JSON.
That means these symbol cannot come from any API call.So if a hacker send the fake component from any api react will not see the typeof:Symbol property and
not add that fake react element to the DOM.
