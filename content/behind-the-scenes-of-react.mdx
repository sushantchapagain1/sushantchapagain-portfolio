Let's start with the basics by understanding what a component is and how it works.
A component is like a blueprint or template of a UI that returns a React element in the element tree, it is usually written in JSX.
From this blueprint or template, we can create one or multiple `component instances` when we use the component.
Each component instance has its own state, props, and lifecycle methods mount, update/re-render, and unmount (more about this later).

When using a component technically its a component instance each component instance will return a `react element`.Component is usually
written in JSX however JSX in transplied to vanilla js with the `React.createElement` function calls by the transpilers like [babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/#jsx-and-react) or other transpilers.
So using component will return a react element that element is a imutable javscript object with necessary properties that react keeps in memory
to create DOM elements for the current component instance.

The `$$typeof` property in react element is used by react to prevent from cross site scripting attacks. notice
that the value of the property is `Symbol` which is a primitive data type in js which cannot be transmitted via JSON.
That means these symbol cannot come from any API call.So if a hacker send the fake component from any api react will not see the typeof:Symbol property and
not add that fake react element to the DOM.

Let's now discuss the subject I mentioned in the component flowchart figure. Basically we will learn steps of how react renders the ui.
Just keep in mind that rendering term doesnot mean its updating the DOM directly or produces any visual changes instead there are some
important process invloved in rendering.

### 1. Render triggered

Rendering process is started by react when a render is triggered mostly on the initial render and state update in any component instances also called re-render.

### 2. Render Phase

In this process react calls the component functions and figures out how DOM should be updated to reflect the state changes however it doesnot update the
dom in this phase, it happens internally it does not produces any visual changes.

### 3. Commit Phase

In this phase react writes the DOM to insert ,update or delete some elements in order to correct the state with the application.

### 4. Browser Paint

In this phase the browser will notice that the DOM has been updated so it repaints the screen, this phase has nothing to do with react
but this final step that users see the changes in the browser.
