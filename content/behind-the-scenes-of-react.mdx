Let's start with the basics by understanding what a component is and how it works.
A component is like a blueprint or template of a UI that returns a React element in the element tree, it is usually written in JSX.
From component, we can create one or multiple `component instances` when we use the component.
Each component instance has its own state, props, and lifecycle methods mount, update/re-render, and unmount.

When using a component technically its a component instance each component instance will return a `react element`.Component is usually
written in JSX however JSX in transplied to vanilla js with the `React.createElement` function calls by the transpilers like [babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/#jsx-and-react) or other transpilers.
So using component will return a react element that element is a imutable javscript object with necessary properties that react keeps in memory
to create DOM elements for the current component instance.

_The term Virtual Dom is not used by React official docs anymore rather they say react tree. But i will use the term Virtual DOM because
there will be so many tree in react and it might confuse some of you._ üòÅ

_Note: The `$$typeof` property in react element is used by react to prevent from cross site scripting attacks. notice
that the value of the property is `Symbol` which is a primitive data type in js which cannot be transmitted via JSON.
That means these symbol cannot come from any API call.So if a hacker send the fake component from any api react will not see the typeof:Symbol property and
not add that fake react element to the DOM._

Let's now discuss the subject I mentioned in the component flowchart figure. Basically we will learn steps of how react renders the ui.
Just keep in mind that rendering term doesnot mean its updating the real DOM directly or produces any visual changes instead there are some
important process invloved while rendering.

### 1. Render triggered

Rendering process is started by react when a render is triggered mostly on the initial render and state update in any component instances also called re-render.
Render triggred is for entire applications but does not update the dom for all.

### 2. Render Phase

In this process react calls the component functions and figures out how DOM should be updated to reflect the state changes however it doesnot update the
real dom in this phase, it happens internally it does not produces any visual changes. In the beginning react goes through the entire component tree take all the
component instances that causes render and this will create updated react elements and all together it will create a js object also called `Virtual DOM`.
Virtual Dom is a tree of all react element created from all the instances from the component tree.

_Virtual Dom is cheap and fast to create multiple trees even if the component tree is very huge._

Updating a state in a parent component causes all of its children to be re-render even if children's state or props are not change.
So again when a state changes in somewhere in application it will create a new virtual dom which is cheap and fast however writing to the DOM
is not cheap and fast. For example in a large complex app a state changed somewhere it would be extremly unoptimized and wastefull to write to the DOM from scratch,
only a small portion of the DOM should be updated the rest should be resued except for inital render.
And thats what react exactly what react will do with the process called `Reconcilation`.

Reconcilation is a process of deciding which DOM elements needs to be inserted, updated, and deleted with a latest state changes with help of
fiber(React v16+) and the `diffing` algorithm. Now lets cover the process after Virtual DOM is created, On the inital render of the application,
based on that virtual dom, fiber creates another tree which is called `Fiber tree`.It is special internal tree where for each component instance and Dom element
there is one fiber. unlike virtual dom fiber tree is not re created on every render, it is never destroyed because it is mutable data structure which gets mutated on every
render. i said each component instance hold its own state props at beginning but internally fiber is the one that takes care of it since there is each fiber for each component
instance has its props, state, side effects, hooks and work queue.

### 3. Commit Phase

In this phase react writes the DOM to insert ,update or delete some elements in order to keep sync the state with the application
by sending the list of dom updates to do in the current fiber tree.

Before the commit phase react library was handling the rendering process but commit phase is handle by `react dom`. React itself does not touch the DOM nor Native Platfrom (iOS and andriod).
React does even know where the result of render phase will be committed and painted, only render phase is handled by react because it was designed to be used independently for multiple platform.
Meaning react can be used to develop web applications using react dom, similarly react native to develop iOS and andriod applications with the Native components like View, Image, Pressable, etc .
and even videos using [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/).

### 4. Browser Paint

In this phase the browser will notice that the DOM has been updated so it repaints the screen, this phase has nothing to do with react
but this final step that users see the changes in the browser.If you want to know more about how this is handled by browsers, you can
