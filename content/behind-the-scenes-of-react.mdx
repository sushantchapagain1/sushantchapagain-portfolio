Let's start with the basics by understanding what a component is and how it works.
A component is like a blueprint or template of a UI that returns a React element in the element tree, usually written in JSX.
From this blueprint or template, we can create one or multiple component instances when we use the component.
Each component instance has its own state, props, and lifecycle methods mount, update/rerender, and unmount (more about this later).
